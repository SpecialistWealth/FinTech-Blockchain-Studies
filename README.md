# Proposal: Blockchain in the Finance Industry

## TOPIC RATIONALE

In recent decades, blockchain technology has emerged as a transforming technology in the finance industry, revolutionizing the traditional financial system, which can be traced back to the early days of human civilization. Blockchain has been poised to address several longstanding challenges to improve transparency and enhance security. Since it is a transformative force in the industry, it sparked my interest. 

This proposal outlines the background of blockchain, which was studied through a preliminary study by reading "A Blockchain in Finance: A Systematic Literature Review," and the research plan with the project's estimated timeline (with the reference provided below). The final report will answer three questions mentioned in detail below under "Research Plan."

## BACKGROUND

The finance industry faced a watershed moment with the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting systemic inefficiencies, opaque operations, and vulnerability to fraud. Blockchain technology emerges as the game-changer, offering a "decentralized ledger that is immutable and operates in a trustless environment," thereby reducing fraud and enhancing transparency (Nakamoto, 2008). Recent adoption by financial giants like BlackRock indicates blockchain's growing acceptance, with blockchain managing assets valued over $10 trillion (Forbes, 2023). Despite its association with Bitcoin, blockchain's utility is far broader, underpinning its significance beyond cryptocurrencies.

In this context, blockchain provides the solution for all the problems presented in a normal centralized database ledger. Blockchain technology is defined as a "decentralized and immutable ledger which operates in a trustless environment," which enhances the required transparency and resistance to tampering, which wasn't a part of the previous model being used.

The popularization of blockchain came after Bitcoin's price soared in 2017 (Forbes, 2017), which made initial investors earn a good amount of cash in the digital gold rush. Thus, creating a promising future for blockchain technology to be adopted by more companies with the maturity of the technology, which is still in its early days.

## RESEARCH PLAN

**Literature Review Objective:** To critically evaluate blockchain's impact on finance through the analysis of 20 research papers.

**Activities:**

*   Systematically review literature focusing on blockchain applications in finance.
*   Analyze real-world blockchain implementations within financial sectors.
*   Identify benefits, challenges, and future trajectories of blockchain integration.

**Article Selection Criteria:**

Articles must address:

1. How blockchain technologies are utilized in finance.
2. Benefits and improvements brought by blockchain.
3. Future applications and potential of blockchain in finance.

Research papers will be collected using Research Gate and Google Scholar.

## PROJECT TIMELINE

The research timeline for the proposal on blockchain in the finance industry is structured over nine to ten weeks:

*   **WEEK 1:** Collect initial set of articles; begin annotations.
*   **WEEK 2:** Finalize article collection; organize into a thematic table.
*   **WEEKS 3-4:** Summarize articles, with week 3 for the first half and week 4 for the remainder.
*   **WEEKS 5-6:** Critical analysis of articles, split evenly over two weeks.
*   **WEEK 7:** Synthesize findings to highlight themes and gaps.
*   **WEEKS 8-9:** Draft report, with week 9 focusing on the latter half.
*   **WEEK 10:** Revise and finalize the report.

## CONCLUSION

This project aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of blockchain technology, which is a "decentralized distributed database that has a consensus algorithm like Proof of Work (PoW) to validate each other's ledgers in nodes maintained by miners."

By addressing the key issues, which are inefficiencies, high transaction costs, and security vulnerabilities, the insight gained from the study will not only contribute to the academic discourse on blockchain but will also provide a foundation for anyone interested in knowing about blockchain as beginners and a key point to master blockchain to advance and adopt the technology, which has a promising future.

## REPOSITORY

A GitHub repository has been maintained throughout the project that will contain all the references, summary articles, and summary tables to maintain transparency for the final critically evaluated report.
